I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
A Spark DataFrame is created from the dataset. (5 points) completed Completed
A temporary table of the original DataFrame is created. (10 points) completed
A query is written that returns the average price, rounded to two decimal places, for a four-bedroom house that was sold in each year. (5 points) 
A query is written that returns the average price, rounded to two decimal places, of a home that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. (5 points)
A query is written that returns the average price of a home with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet for each year built rounded to two decimal places. (5 points)
A query is written that returns the view rating for the average price for homes that are greater than or equal to $350,000, rounded to two decimal places. (The output shows the run time for this query.) (10 points)
A cache of the temporary "home_sales" table is created and validated. (10 points)
The query from step 6 is run on the cached temporary table, and the run time is computed. (10 points)
A partition of the home sales dataset by the "date_built" field is created, and the formatted parquet data is read. (10 points)
A temporary table of the parquet data is created. (10 points)
The query from step 6 is run on the parquet temporary table, and the run time is computed. (10 points)
The "home_sales" temporary table is uncached and verified. (10 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
